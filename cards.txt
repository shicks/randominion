# Ideas:
# Sliders for things like #mechanics, complexity, attackiness
#  average cost (+stddev?), avg speed, etc?
#  -- stddev for each slider?

# Features - common/rare
#   - common features can be balanced - pick different or same
#   - rare features -> may still want different???
# Synergies
#   - pick cards with same synergy? and synergizing cards...?
# Mechanics
#   - limit different mechanics, group same
